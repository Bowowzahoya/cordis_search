The advent of web-mediated social networks has created a dynamic global market for digital music, collateral services and new user behaviours with significant challenges and opportunities for exploitation. For Europe to leverage its position as a world leader in music creativity, production and mobile distribution, a programme of digital music search technology RTD is needed to ensure coherent targeted support for innovation and underpin competitive strategies for maintaining European excellence.MIR field has contributed to the success of EU music companies such as Last.fm, Shazam, and BMAT who have started to revolutionise the way music is produced, stored and marketed. Although these services have generated a growing audience reaching over 100 million users in Dec. 2010, the EU music revolution is still in the making. By expanding its context and addressing challenges such as multimodal information, multiculturalism and multidisciplinarity, MIR has the potential for a major impact on the future economy, the arts and education, not merely through applications of technical components, but also by evolving to address questions of fundamental human understanding, with a view to building a digital economy founded on ""uncopiable intangibles"": personalisation, interpretation, embodiment, findability and community. Within this wider context we propose to refer to the field of MIR as Music Information ReSearch (MIReS) and thus widen its scope, ensuring its focus is centered on quality of experience with greater relevance to human networks and communities.The Roadmap for MIReS will provide a meta-analysis of the MIR discipline, address emergent contexts and major challenges, formulate research evaluation standards for the discipline, contribute to the establishment of music production and digital library management standards, engage a variety of stakeholders from different disciplines of academia and industry and deliver innovative platforms for co-creative workshops focusing on horizon-scanning and technology foresight. The roadmap will also include a framework for the establishment of a MIR excellence network, involving the field drivers and stakeholders (music researchers, industry representatives, strategists and policy makers).The MIReS action is therefore expected to impact on (i) policy making and research planning (alignment to other ongoing initiatives such as CHORUS+ or the Media Search Cluster); (ii) technological innovation addressing standards in the field, state-of-the-art description and future challenges definition; (iii) new social behaviours, creativity, economy and education; and (iv) long-term transfer of innovation to industry ensuring future academic excellence and EU competitiveness in the world music market.";"2017-04-20 02:14:28";"100794"

In the last years, she has become interested in two new applications of the Malliavin calculus, which are Statistical Inference for SDEs and applications to Mathematical Finance.The aim of this proposal is to consider two different types of SDES: (i) SDEs driven by the sum of a Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure; (ii) SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion. The coefficients of both SDEs are assumed to depend on some parameter  that needs to be estimated in the following cases: (a) when the trajectory of the SDE is observed continuously during a fixed time interval; (b) when the trajectory is observed discretely at n fixed times. Both cases will be studied, but the proposal concentrates in case (b), as is a more challenging and realistic problem.The proposal is divided into three research projects whose goals are: (1) Obtain upper and lower bounds for the density of the solution to the two types of SPDEs (i) and (ii), by means of the Malliavin Calculus; (2) Use these bounds in order to prove the local asymptotic normality (LAN) for the models (i) and (ii), and then apply Hajek-Lecam's theorem to obtain asymptotically efficient estimators for the parameter of the equations; (3) Study Monte Carlo methods and exact simulation of the SDE model with jumps (i), and apply these computational methods to the following financial problems: jump volatility models and numerical computations of greeks.In addition to the three research projects, the proposal aims to develop a research network on Stochastic Analysis and applications, by organizing weekly seminars and two international conferences at the University Pompeu Fabra, where the researcher has been offered a permanent associate professor position.";"2016-06-27 11:04:34";"108019"

In the present project, the candidate will have exclusive access to one of these datasets which consists of brain recordings in primates during a decision making task.  The candidate will employ his expertise in some areas of information theory and coding to formulate a novel hypothesis to be tested on these available data. This hypothesis states that causal interactions between neurons in a population encode information about decisions. This interdisciplinary line of investigation represents a changing point in the candidate’s career. On the one hand, the candidate will be trained in the neurophysiological aspects of the problem. On the other, he will develop emerging methods to capture causal interactions between neuronal responses and then represent the hypothesized “encoding patterns”. From a scientific point of view, this project will provide one of the key tools to understand information processing in a decision-making process and  study sources of brain disorder based on the dynamics of encoding patterns.

Arguably, employment risk is one of the biggest sources of uncertainty most individuals face in their life time. Likewise, exploiting the synergies and complementarities between differentially skilled workers is amongst the greatest challenges to firms' hiring decisions. The objective is to analyze the efficiency properties and as a consequence evaluate the role for policy. In order to establish the implications of the mechanisms that govern risk and diversity, I elaborate on concrete applications and discuss estimation in different labor market settings.In the presence of Labor Market Risk I address the question how asset holdings exacerbate wage inequality. Workers are exposed to the risk of unemployment, and workers with few assets will trade off the lower riskiness of a job against lower wages. Different asset holdings translate into different wages, thus amplifying inequality due to assets with wage inequality. The proposed analysis of unemployment risk can solve for an equilibrium model that incorporates the distribution of assets, while at the same time allowing for heterogeneity in skills. There is no doubt that fully understanding the asset-skill tradeoff is of primary importance for labor market policy. I then study a different angle of labor market risk, namely risk that is due to matching stochastic types, which introduces ex post mismatch. Ex ante, agents match based on the distribution of possible realizations of ex post types. This model is conducive to identification of complementarities between workers and the value of risk sharing.Skill Diversity, or the allocation of differentially skilled workers across firms of different productivity, is a central feature of the labor market. The aim of this research is to embed the optimal worker composition within firms into standard macro environments to study technological change, information aggregation and spatial diversity.";"2017-11-20 13:58:22";"188486"

The main aim of the project is to increase our understanding of legal and normative discourse in light of contemporary accounts of the semantics and pragmatics of deontic modals, and of collective intentionality. This is a highly interdisciplinary project, connecting various philosophical disciplines with jurisprudence. The project will apply state-of-the-art theories and arguments of contextualist semantics about deontic modals and value predicates to the case of statements of law (i.e. statements of what, according to law, one ought to do). This will be achieved by a systematic exploration of the relationship between four debates in four different areas: first, the problem of the semantics and pragmatics of ought and might claims in philosophy of language; second, the debate on the perspectival nature of legal statements in legal philosophy; third, the debate on dispositional accounts of normative facts and values in metaphysics; and fourth the debate on collective intentionality in the philosophy of mind and action. Marques believes that there is a common set of issues underlying these seldom-connected debates. Her guiding research idea is that contextualist semantics is adequate for all normative statements, and difficult cases can be explained with a combination of (i) pragmatic accounts of the metalinguistic selection of appropriate standards, and (ii) proper accounts of collective intentionality. The project will pursue three objectives in particular: (O1) To develop the case for contextualism about deontic modals in the domain of normative legal statements and judgments. (O2) To investigate the role of joint commitments and collective intentionality in normative disputes, and the constitution of normative facts. (O3) To assess the relevance of the results achieved under O1 and O2 for the ongoing debate about legal positivism and the nature of law.";"2017-02-21 09:06:42";"187671"

The aim is to determine the basic elements that make countries more prone to social conflicts and then identify a set of feasible policies to prevent future episodes of violence. The project considers the causes and the propagation mechanisms of social conflicts of different intensity. The main objective of the project is to the study the institutional designs that may prevent, or mitigate, such social conflicts. Therefore, the analysis of economic institutions (such as property rights, etc.), political institutions and structure (democracy, decentralization, political systems, etc.), and the type of political leaders, that can help to prevent, conflict in potentially conflictive societies. From a methodological perspective, the project proposes to overcome some statistical pitfalls present in most of the previous literature on the determinants of civil wars and conflicts. The use of simple linear regressions, or a probit/logit specification, imposes very strong identification conditions that are likely to be violated. The current consensus, which emerges from those analyses, is that poverty is the single, most important determinant of civil wars. This result could be an artifact of simultaneity problems: the incidence of civil wars and poverty may be driven by the same determinants, some of which are probably missing. We propose to check the robustness of this consensus idea, and the importance of the institutional design, using other econometric procedures (instrumental variables and matching methods) which are subject to weaker identification conditions than the traditional regressions. Finally, we plan to investigate methods to deal with the missing data problem that plague the study of the determinants of civil wars.";"2017-05-29 12:34:13";"87583"

The importance of this question is that concepts permit us to bring meaning to our experiences; they are core to language and nonverbal behavior and their impairment after brain damage generates significant disability. Previous studies have mostly focused on object concepts (e.g., animals, tools, etc.) rather than action concepts (i.e., to run, to think, etc.). In our view, exploring our conceptual representations of actions is fundamental for obtaining a more complete picture of how the brain mediates our knowledge of the world. In this project we use the functional magnetic resonance imaging technique (fMRI) with healthy individuals as a tool for addressing two controversial questions in the field. First, we will examine whether a differential representation of action and object concepts exists in a particular brain region (the posterior-lateral-temporal cortex- PLTC). In particular, we will try to demonstrate that the PLTC subserves the representation of actions relative to objects, and that this is due to a conceptual (action vs. object) rather than a grammatical (verb vs. noun) distinction (Experiment 1). Then, we will examine whether  the PLTC is specialized in representing action concepts to the extent that it differentially responds to homophone words marked as verbs (she drinks) relative those marked as nouns (these drinks; Experiment 2). Second, we will determine the nature of action concepts by examining whether they are represented in an abstract manner (Experiment 3). If so, we will investigate whether the amount of motion information carried by an action (e.g., run vs. think) influences how these abstract representations are organized in the brain (Experiment 4).";"2019-08-02 10:20:15";"99212"

My interest in EP was stimulated during my postdoctoral position at the University of California at Berkeley (2005-2009). There I had the opportunity to participate in the process in which Prof. Rubinsky brought the concept of using irreversible EP as an ablation technique from a mere idea into a clinical reality. In May 2009 I moved to Prof. Mir's lab at Villejuif (France) as a preliminary step in order to reintegrate myself into the EP European research arena. During the 90s, Prof. Mir pioneered the use of EP for enhancing the penetration of anti-tumor drugs. Control over the field magnitude that develops in tissues is crucial for EP therapies. During my postdoctoral position I introduced a set of techniques for such a purpose based on the concept of employing conductive gels. Feasibility of this method was demonstrated experimentally in superficial tumors and I anticipate that this methodology could be also useful for the treatment of different cancers, particularly those located in hollow organs such as esophagus, stomach and colon, which in some occasions are inoperable with current techniques.

Yet, our perceptual experience is not a sensory piecemeal, but a unitary phenomenon brought about by Multisensory Integration mechanisms. MSI is in charge of binding sensory input to create faithful and coherent representations of the environment, an ability that confers important advantages in terms of optimizing behavioural outcomes. For example, people often find it easier to speak with someone when they can see their partner’s face, as lip and facial movements compensate for acoustic noise. The novelty of the project is that it focuses on internal processes, and in particular attention, to be of utmost importance during MSI. Attention enables efficient allocation of limited cognitive and neural resources, and therefore it plays a paramount role in perception, cognition and action. The aim is to understand the interplay between attention and the mechanisms of multisensory integration. Unravelling this interplay presents important challenges but, in return, promises to provide very important insights into how perception is accomplished by the humanmind and brain. In particular, the driving hypothesis underlying the present proposal is that objects of perception are multi-sensory defined events, and that attention plays a key role in building up and maintaining these perceptual representations. The strategy is to address this dynamic interplay between MSI and Attention by addressing a set of key specific research questions by means of converging methodological approaches.

The Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC) project aims at resolving this paradox by using a multi-disciplinary approach to show the functional role of consciousness in adaptive behaviour, to identify its underlying neuronal principles and to construct a neuromorphic robot based real-time conscious architecture. CDAC proposes that the shift from surviving in a physical world to one that is dominated by intentional agents requires radically different control architectures combining parallel and distributed control loops to assure real-time operation together with a second level of control that assures coherence through sequential coherent representation of self and the task domain, i.e. consciousness.

Most IT research is being carried out with a western centred approach and as a result, our data models, cognition models, user models, interaction models, ontologies, … are all culturally biased. This fact is quite evident in music information research, since, despite the world's richness in musical cultures, most of the research is centred on CDs and metadata of our western commercial music. CompMusic wants to break this huge research bias. By approaching musical information modelling from a multicultural perspective it aims at advancing our state of the art while facilitating the discovery and reuse of the music produced outside the western commercial context. But the development of computational models to address the world’s music information richness cannot be done from the West looking out; we have to involve researchers and musical experts immersed in the different cultures. Their contribution is fundamental to develop the appropriate multicultural musicological and cognitive frameworks from which we should then carry our research on finding appropriate musical features, ontologies, data representations, user interfaces and user centred approaches.

Using these music cultures as case studies, cultures that are alive and have a strong influence in current society, we can develop rich information models that can take advantage of the existing information coming from musicological and cultural studies, from mature performance practice traditions and from active social contexts. With this approach we aim at challenging the current western centred information paradigms, advance our IT research, and contribute to our rich multicultural society.";"2019-08-02 10:07:24";"99349"

Neural models implementing Bayesian models have proved useful to uncover neural computations in a variety of paradigms. Still no existing neurocomputational model provides a general framework for understanding perception in naturalistic conditions. Indeed these models suffer from three shortcomings: i) they cannot perform accurate inference in naturalistic environments where numerous objects interact in complex fashion; ii) they cannot simultaneously represent likelihood estimates over the presence of several objects in the same graphical model; iii) they cannot deal with correlated sensory evidence, though such correlations are ubiquitous in sensory systems.We propose a new unifying model of perception called Constrained Entropy Maximization Network (CEMNet) that provides a theoretical framework for inference in complex naturalistic environments. CEMNet stores an internal model of the environment by representing regularities across stochastic variables as constraints; those constraints shape the response of the network. The aim of the project is to develop the computational model of CEMNet and test it empirically. We will first study how CEMNet can be implemented in a realistic neural network. Second, we will simulate the network and show that, unlike existing neural models, CEMNet can deal with the difficulties of inference in complex environments. Third, a behavioral experiment will monitor how human subjects integrate correlated sensory evidence. Last, we will probe the ability of human subjects to simultaneously maintain likelihood estimates over multiple interacting variables in an audiovisual motion integration paradigm. We will record neural signals in MagnetoEncephaloGraphy while subjects perform the task and look for a specific neural signature of CEMNet signals.";"2016-06-20 10:55:47";"188178"

Additionally, it has been well established that one of the main reasons for the EU negative balance in the supply and consumption of gas are faults in measurements. Consortium SMEs have identified a clear need to develop a metropolitan gas/water metering system based on wire-less technology to send gas and water supplies readings to their control centre. The system will require no maintenance (battery powered sensors with life-time about 10-15 years) and will provide authenticable and secure data transmission. Timely and accurate recording of the consumption of gas, water and electricity is important as it will also help in identifying any leakages through the analysis of the actual quantity supplied and recorded by the meters. The commercial objective is to develop an ultra low power-consumption, battery-powered, wireless, cost effective and self organizing sensor network for maintenance-free automatic home meter reading applications. This network will be form by smart sensors which will include gas or water counter, logging consumption, outage detection, real-time clock and 2-way communications for remote control (i.e. switch on/switch off) and will support a huge number of sensors (+100).";"2019-07-16 22:16:59";"92925"

The protease cleaves viral polyprotein chains resulting in virion maturation and infectivity. The first stage of this process is the association of such chains containing embedded pseudo-folded protease monomers, followed by the intramolecular autocatalytic cleavage of the protease out of the polyprotein chains. Whilst, the structure, dynamics and function of mature/free HIV-1 protease have been extensively studied at the atomistic level, the molecular structure and binding mechanism of the embedded autocatalytic protease are unknown. Using large scale fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on the microsecond timescale, afforded by the computational infrastructure of GPUGrid, the transient structure, dynamics and auto-binding mechanism of embedded HIV-1 protease will be investigated. The aim of these investigations is to distinguish at a molecular level (a) the gating mechanism of mature HIV-1 protease in response to ligands (b) the gating mechanism of intramolecular N-terminal association of the embedded HIV-1 protease and (c) the feasibility of intramolecular C-terminal cleavage by the protease. The release of mature HIV-1 protease is a critical rate-limiting step in the maturation of the virus. Successful inhibition of this stage of the viral life-cycle may lead to a potent increase in the efficacy of AIDS therapy. Unfortunately, structure-based inhibitors designed for the mature/free protease are ineffective against the embedded-protease. A final aim of this investigation will thus be to identify an ensemble of macromolecular structures that could be used as pharmacophores in the development of inhibitors that target the embedded protease.";"2017-05-29 20:05:47";"94746"

It will look at the genetic bases of language by conducting Genome-wide Association Studies correlating phenotypic variation in linguistic aptitude, particularly for language learning, with genetic markers.

At this juncture, cellular systems have become limited, first and foremost, by their own interference. It is becoming increasingly clear that major new improvements in spectral efficiency will have to entail addressing such intercell interference. Traditionally, a user is assigned to a cell and it then communicates with that cell site while causing interference to all other sites in the system. The premise of NetMIMO is that, in the uplink specifically, intercell interference is merely a superposition of signals that were intended for other cell sites, i.e., signals that happen to have been collected at the wrong place. If these signals could be properly classified and routed, they would in fact cease to be interference and become useful in the detection of the information they bear. (A dual observation can be made about the downlink.) This insight naturally leads to the conclusion that, ultimately, the goal should be to serve all users through all the sites within their range of influence. While challenging, this is theoretically possible by virtue of the fact that the cell sites are connected by a powerful backbone network. This ambitious idea leverages the almost unlimited bandwidth available in optical wireline networks to transcend the burden of wireless intercell interference. In the NetMIMO framework then, the notion of a cell gets blurred once users are no longer assigned to specific sites. Ultimately, there is a network of sites serving a pool of users. While this is a conceptually simple proposition, it poses numerous hurdles and challenges that this project aims to resolve.";"2019-07-16 21:09:25";"88744"

How does the baby navigate through the immense search space, being such space dependent on each language?In this project, I will explore the relationship between mechanisms of attention and cognitive control, and language acquisition. I will approach the issue through two different strategies. First, I will analyse how possessing better mechanisms of attention and control contributes to tuning the language processing system to the environmental language’s specificities. To this end, I will start by measuring language and attention development in 11- and 30-month-old children. Then, I will evaluate language and attention in a group of adults, capitalising on the important individual differences existing in non-native speech perception. Second, I will take the opposite perspective and explore how specific language exposure (namely, bilingualism) sculpts mechanisms of cognitive control. In this research line, I will focus on how bilingual exposure alters mechanisms of attention and control in preverbal infants (of which meagre evidence exists). The project will focus on (but will not be constrained to) the way the phoneme inventory of the native language is established.

Despite the existence of numerous association studies aiming to identify genetic variants involved in these disorders, inconsistencies in replication studies are common and just a few examples of links between gene variants and psychiatric disorders have been accepted. Several factors may be underlying the failure on replication: difficulties on the definition of clinical phenotypes, existence of distinct disease incidences or disease susceptibility variants among populations and, finally, differences in Linkage Disequilibrium and allele frequencies because of diverse population history. Whole genome association studies (WGAS) are powerful methods to map disease genes, however, these expensive techniques have been unsuccessful for psychiatric disorders. An alternative approach could be the use of mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium (MALD), an efficient and economical method to localize disease-causing variants between two historically separated populations. MALD has already been successful for identification of disease loci in African American populations and, similarly, it is hoped to be a powerful tool in Latin American populations. We propose the design of an admixture panel of SNPs to map susceptibility genes for psychiatric disorders, particularly substance use and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders, by the analysis of native (Aymara) and recently admixed populations from Chile.

Even if the construction of the state in Latin America is initially founded on the sectors of the bureaucracy and the army that were inherited from the colonial period, it undergoes great transformations starting from the Revolution of 1810 and especially during the wars of Independence (1810-1825). In most of the new nations that are being forged, the wars of Independence and the ensuing long years of civil war demand that stable military and police forces be formed in order to construct the indispensable monopoly of legitimate violence that characterizes state domination. This process required the localization of the enough resources to cover the enormous expenses that these military forces incurred. At the same time, a body of bureaucrats had to be created and paid, so that it would take on the task of creating a system to generate resources.

Therefore, there is a major focus on developing approaches to manipulate DC function for immunotherapy. It is well known that changes in cellular activation are coupled to changes in cellular metabolism. However, only recently, based on studies with T cells and macrophages, the picture is emerging that manipulation of cellular metabolism can be used to shape immune responses. This field of immunometabolism is rapidly evolving as one of the new frontiers in science. Nonetheless, little is known about the metabolic processes that support DC activation or about the metabolic requirements for DCs to drive Th1, Th2 or Treg responses. My proposal aims to fill this gap and focuses on the novel concept that cellular metabolism regulates the immune-polarizing properties of DCs.Based on my recently published work and preliminary data, I hypothesize (1) that DCs priming Th1 responses are metabolically characterized by a switch to glycolytic metabolism, whereas Th2- or Treg-polarizing DCs, have a catabolic kind of metabolism that is dependent on mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and (2) that these states of metabolism are required for their immune-polarizing capacity.To address this, my project aims (a) to characterize and compare the metabolic profiles of Th1-, Th2- and Treg-polarizing DCs and (b) to determine whether their metabolic programs underpin their T cell-polarizing capacity. (c) Based on these findings I aim to determine whether deliberate modulation of glycolytic or mitochondrial metabolism can alter the immune-polarizing capacity of DCs in such a way that they become either more immunogenic or tolerogenic in vivo. These studies can readily contribute to the development of novel metabolism-based strategies for improving DC-based immunotherapy.";"2016-03-31 23:08:04";"187011"

The brain is continually faced with this task: eg, each retinal photoreceptor responds to light from a small bit of space compared with the size of real-world objects. In the time domain, early sensory neurons (visual, auditory and tactile) signal only instantaneous external stimuli, leaving the brain with the task of reconstructing events that extend over time (eg, speech).  Neural computation of global constructs from local signals is therefore fundamental and ubiquitous, yet our understanding of it is still rudimentary. We will use neural modeling to study the topic. We have two specific goals, addressing two tasks which we have previously characterized experimentally, behaviorally and with brain imaging.  (i) Recover the global motion of objects from local motion signals. For example, a spinning wheel's global motion corresponds to a single quantity, its angular velocity; but each point on it generates a local motion signal of a different direction and speed. The task is further complicated since other nearby local motion signals may arise from independently moving objects. The modeling will implement and test our theory that global motion computation is achieved by continual neural computation between two modules, one specializing in integration and the other in segmentation. (ii) Build models of neural networks with a hierarchical organization of Temporal Receptive Windows (TRWs). Defining a neuron's TRW as the length of time prior to a response during which sensory information can affect that response, we have recently shown that the brain is organized with a hierarchy of TRWs, ranging from 3 sec in sensory areas to 40 sec in higher cortical areas. The models will be used for studying basic properties of such networks and for starting to apply them to real-world tasks.";"2019-08-02 15:25:39";"104348"

Large efforts of data analysis from EEG and fMRI data, as well as of modelling brain activity have been accomplished recently. Here, we have identified two fundamental problems that the field is facing in order to develop further. First, a common factor in the current models of cortical networks is their lack of external stimulation, i.e. they only simulate cortical activity that emulates the resting-state. But the brain is responsible for collecting and processing information of the environment, and therefore, its function cannot be understood in the absence of external stimuli.Second, current EEG and fMRI techniques provide an extremely valuable window into the working brain by detecting the degree of activation of brain regions. However, there is currently no framework to understand which are the precise information processes happening at the neuronal level behind the observed activations. Inspired by these questions, we present an interdisciplinary project that aims at establishing grounding work for the future advances in those problems: 1) We will perform a systematic investigation of the impact of external stimulation in models of cortical networks. The dependence of the emerging collective dynamical phenomena will be studied in terms of the network topology and of the physical properties of the stimuli. 2) We will develop information theoretical measures to quantify the degrees of segregation and integration caused in the brain by the presence of external stimulation, and 3) we will apply those measures to specifically designed EEG experiments for corroboration.""";"2015-03-11 15:15:30";"107303"

Illumination of delicate anatomical structures like nerves will have a direct influence on the quality of life of patients and as such creates a new window of opportunities for surgical guidance and for the chemical development of hybrid imaging agents. To illuminate both somatic and autonomic peripheral nerves, imaging agents will be developed that bind to receptors on myelinating Schwann cells and/or accumulate in neurons. These different targeting concepts dictate the use of different scaffold molecules varying from targeted antibodies to modified neurotoxin proteins that act as bionanoparticles and viral capsids, each scaffold demanding different synthetic routes for functionalization.

This greatly limits practicality, scalability and commercialisation. The development of a strategy for creation of universal engineered T-cells is the first key aim of this consortium. There is an increased appreciation of the immunological hostilities (CAR) T-cells face in the tumour microenvironment, and prevention of this local immune suppressive effect will likely be critical in permitting effective tumour control. The second main aim of this proposal is therefore to engineer CAR T-cells to be resistant to the hostile microenvironment. CAR T-cells can only be effective if they can access the tumour site.

Approximately 1 in 9 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and many will receive chemotherapy and achieve long-term cancer control. However, in approximately one-third of these women, cancer will recur. This is thought to be due to the presence of chemotherapy-resistant ‘breast cancer stem cells’. Two Polycomb-group proteins, Bmi1 and Ezh2, are frequently over-expressed in breast cancer, suggesting that these epigenetic regulators may play a role in breast tumorigenesis. Interestingly, Bmi1 and Ezh2 are also known to be involved in the maintenance of adult stem cells and in normal mammary gland development. Based on these observations, we postulate that Ezh2 and Bmi1 are critical for maintaining mammary stem cell identity and that mutations leading to the continuous expression of these Polycomb-group genes contribute to the generation of breast cancer stem cells. This project will study the parallels between the role of Polycomb genes in normal mammary stem cell maintenance and their role in breast cancer. We will use novel transgenic mice that express doxycycline-regulatable short hairpin (sh)RNAs to Bmi1 and Ezh2 alone, or in combination with established mammary tumor models that closely resemble human disease. Using these mice, we will investigate whether a) knockdown of Bmi1 and Ezh2 causes a regression of the normal and/or cancer stem cell compartment and b) whether this can be exploited to eradicate mammary tumors. Understanding the way in which Ezh2 and Bmi1 exert their effects may lead to novel targeted therapies for breast cancers, which may lead to the eradication of those cells that have the capacity to initiate tumor recurrence.

This leads to activation of a DNA damage response that induces irreversible growth arrest or cell death and serves to suppress tumorigenesis by preventing outgrowth of incipient cancer cells. Furthermore, by limiting replicative potential, telomere dysfunction contributes to aging. However, deprotected chromosome ends are also subject to DNA repair activities that lead to chromosome end-to-end fusions. Upon cell division these fusions give rise to genomic instability through breakage-fusion-bridge cycles generating complex, unbalanced chromosome rearrangements. Cells with such instable genomes are highly prone to develop into cancer. The mechanisms underlying the telomere damage response and telomere-driven genomic instability are poorly understood. To increase our understanding of the cellular consequences of telomere dysfunction we will perform genome-wide functional genetic screens to identify factors with important roles in the telomere damage response and telomere-driven genomic instability. We will mechanistically study these genes for their role in the cellular response to telomere dysfunction. In addition, we will address if these factors act uniquely at telomeres or also affect the response to DNA lesions. Due to their unbiased nature these screens represent a unique opportunity to obtain highly novel and potentially unsuspected insights in the events following telomere deprotection. This work will lead to significantly increased mechanistic understanding of how dysfunctional telomeres affect genome stability, cancer development and aging, but might also lead to new insights in responses to DNA damage in general. Furthermore our research findings will facilitate development of new therapeutic strategies for inhibiting cancer and aging.";"2016-03-31 13:18:29";"105023"

For any investigational and therapeutical purposes, well-defined ubiquitin(-like) conjugates are of prime importance and to date, these have mainly been constructed by enzyme based strategies. However, besides the general potential problems of enzymatic transformations (e.g. yield, isolation, expression), the promiscuous nature of ubiquitination severely limits their general applicability. Despite this and the growing evidence that structural organization of ubiquitin chains is more complicated and important than anticipated, the development of synthetic strategies towards well-defined Ub(ls) has received little attention. This proposal will present synthetic strategies which I believe hold great potential as general approaches towards well-defined ubiquitin conjugates. Chemical approaches and resulting reagents are not only desired for their analytical value but will also assist future developments of targeted therapeutics.";"2017-05-25 18:28:58";"90280"

Yet, the intrinsic limitations of current gene replacement approaches based on semi-randomly integrating vectors, and the occurrence in some clinical trials of severe adverse events related to gene transfer, prevent safe deployment and broad application of gene therapy. This project aims to overcome these limits by exploiting the results of an earlier highly successful integrated project (PERSIST), which demonstrated the potential of gene targeting technologies based on engineered nucleases to provide radical new solutions to these hurdles. By homology-driven repair of a nuclease-targeted dysfunctional gene, we will insert a functional copy downstream its own endogenous promoter in HSC, thus restoring both function and physiological expression control. For adoptive T-cell therapy, we will combine nuclease-mediated disruption of the endogenous TCR genes with transfer of tumor-specific TCR, thus editing T-cell specificity at the genetic level. We will develop these innovative approaches into robust, scalable and clinically ready processes for safe ex vivo genetic modification of hematopoietic cells, and apply them to the treatment of paradigmatic diseases that provide a favourable risk-benefit ratio for clinical testing. Because both HSC and T-cell based gene therapy strategies share methodological aspects and technological challenges, we will address them systematically by involving a SME which holds unique know-how and top-level expertise in vector manufacturing and HSC and T-cell processing, as already established for our previous and ongoing gene therapy trials. Our findings will lead to the design of new clinical trials to provide durable benefits or even a cure to patients suffering from severe and otherwise fatal diseases, and representing a template for broaden application in medicine.";"2017-09-10 09:30:19";"108697"

While the heterogeneity in phenotype and function of dendritic cells has been well described, our understanding of the in vivo origin of different dendritic cells subsets is still limited. Identification of the cellular intermediates on their way to dendritic cell differentiation will form an essential step to understand the dynamic regulation of the number, localization, and functionality of these cells and should contribute to the development of vaccination and immunotherapy strategy that rely on dendritic cells.The objectives of this project are to elucidate the genealogy of dendritic cells in vivo. To this purpose, I plan to use two complementary approaches. First, I will measure the fate of individual dendritic cells progenitors by the new experimental technology of barcoding that allows the tracing of a large number of individual cells in vivo. As the data obtained from barcoding experiments require mathematical modeling for proper interpretation, I will then develop a modeling approach to analyze the data. The results obtained in this project should yield a map of dendritic cells development in vivo under both steady state conditions and during infection.This cross-disciplinary approach to analyze dendritic cell commitment that I propose here should lead to a description of the genealogy of dendritic cell subsets, while at the same time providing a conceptual framework to analyze lineage differentiation issues for other cell types.""";"2019-08-02 14:34:56";"98734"

Cultured human cells are widely used to model and study aspects of human disease. Although human cells can be analyzed and manipulated in numerous ways, their genome has remained refractory to efficient mutagenesis-based analysis.We have developed an insertional mutagenesis-based approach in haploid and near-haploid human cells.  We have shown that this approach enables the generation of null alleles for most human genes and can be used to pinpoint genes that are involved in phenotypes of interest. We have made use of parallel sequencing approaches to generate high-density genetic overviews of genes that are required for phenotypic cell states. In a variety of genetic screens we have identified host factors required for infection of cells by influenza virus, the first entry receptor for a Clostridium Difficile toxin and a set of host factors that play a role in the entry of Ebola virus. Importantly, we can carry out and analyze a genetic screen in a period of weeks in a cost-effective manner.This application outlines experiments aimed at identification and detailed characterization of host factors that play a role in Filovirus infection. Moreover, we propose a number of experiments to gain mechanistic insight in the role of the Niemann-Pick C1 cholesterol transporter in entry, tropism and the fusion process of Ebola virus. Furthermore we propose to develop refinements in our screening approach. Finally, we will apply our haploid screening platform to generate a “Host Factors Atlas’ for 50 diverse viruses that infect the human population. We foresee that the outlined experiments will provide an detailed and accurate overview of the unusual entry-route used by Filoviridae, will make our screening platform more powerful and will generate a much-needed overview of host factors used by a compendium of viruses.";"2016-03-31 12:59:07";"105593"

Over 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by metastatic disease emphasizing the urgency for more research in this area. While experimental evidence indicates that tumor cells must acquire specific genetic mutations to disseminate and colonize distant organs, these genetic alterations are not sufficient for successful metastasis formation. The microenvironment of metastatic organs must also be pre-conditioned and adapted prior to the arrival of tumor cells. In other words, metastasis is not a passive event – a ‘pre-metastatic niche’ must be established. Bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) play a critical role in this process by secreting soluble factors to direct the recruitment of disseminated tumor cells to specific sites. Experimental studies suggest that both innate and adaptive immune cells initiate the pre-metastatic niche, but involvement of particular BMDC populations is largely dependent on tumor type. Together, these data support the hypothesis that breast cancer metastasis is not a passive event, but is regulated by specific BMDC populations in target organs. The overall goal of this application is to examine the cellular and molecular changes that occur in pre-metastatic organs and determine which are crucial for metastasis formation using a novel breast cancer metastasis model developed by the Host laboratory. To assess this, I propose to 1) Perform an in depth kinetic characterization of disseminated tumor cell colonization of distant metastatic organs; and 2) Determine which BMDC population regulates the pre-metastatic niche and their functional significance to metastasis formation. Evaluating the specific role of BMDCs in the initiation of metastases will identify novel targets for breast cancer patients to prevent future metastatic development and/or combat established metastases.""";"2019-08-02 12:00:13";"99420"

This post-translational modification controls most cellular processes, including DNA repair, trafficking and protein degradation. Ubiquitin conjugation onto any of its 7 own lysine residues or onto its N-terminus results in a large number of differently linked polymers; the shape, charge and size of which determine how they interact with ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs). Binding to proteins containing such domains triggers further events that determine the fate of a Ub-tagged substrate in subsequent biochemical events in a Ub chain topology dependent manner. Malfunction of these signal transduction events contributes to the pathology of human disease. Although all Ub linkages are found in cells and all likely have specific functions, only few of them have been intensively studied so far as most linkages cannot be generated biochemically.This project will investigate how Ub linkages are recognized by UBDs to transduce cellular signals in a chain specific manner, including all linkages with all their possible topoisomers. This information will then be used to generate pharmacological modulators aimed at interfering with specific UBD-mediated signal transduction events.";"2017-12-18 10:13:11";"100265"

First, only a minority of patients respond to most forms of (chemo)therapy. It is generally believed that this poor responsiveness to drugs has its origin, at least in part, in the molecular heterogeneity of cancer. This heterogeneity requires the use of biomarkers to stratify patients having seemingly similar tumors according to their likely responses to specific cancer therapies. To identify such biomarkers, we will use large-scale genetic screens to identify genes that are causally involved in controlling responses to cancer drugs. Such genes are likely biomarkers of drug responsiveness in the clinic. Availability of such drug response biomarkers will facilitate a more personalized therapy choice for each individual patient. A second major deficit in effective cancer therapy is the lack of sufficient highly selective drug targets. The large-scale cancer genome re-sequencing efforts already indicate that there is a paucity of druggable genes that are consistently mutated in cancer and the same holds true for genes that are consistently over-expressed in cancer. Hence, there is an urgent need for innovative drug targets that have a similar cancer-selectivity as the genes that are specifically mutated or over-expressed in cancer. In this project, we will use large-scale loss of function genetic screens, exploiting the concept of synthetic lethality , to identify genes whose inactivation is selectively toxic to cells having a defined cancer-specific genetic alteration. Drugs against these targets will be highly cancer-selective, as their activity hinges on the presence of a specific genetic defect, which is only present in the cancer cell.";"2019-07-16 20:25:57";"94579"
