The advent of web-mediated social networks has created a dynamic global market for digital music, collateral services and new user behaviours with significant challenges and opportunities for exploitation. For Europe to leverage its position as a world leader in music creativity, production and mobile distribution, a programme of digital music search technology RTD is needed to ensure coherent targeted support for innovation and underpin competitive strategies for maintaining European excellence.MIR field has contributed to the success of EU music companies such as Last.fm, Shazam, and BMAT who have started to revolutionise the way music is produced, stored and marketed. Although these services have generated a growing audience reaching over 100 million users in Dec. 2010, the EU music revolution is still in the making. By expanding its context and addressing challenges such as multimodal information, multiculturalism and multidisciplinarity, MIR has the potential for a major impact on the future economy, the arts and education, not merely through applications of technical components, but also by evolving to address questions of fundamental human understanding, with a view to building a digital economy founded on ""uncopiable intangibles"": personalisation, interpretation, embodiment, findability and community. Within this wider context we propose to refer to the field of MIR as Music Information ReSearch (MIReS) and thus widen its scope, ensuring its focus is centered on quality of experience with greater relevance to human networks and communities.The Roadmap for MIReS will provide a meta-analysis of the MIR discipline, address emergent contexts and major challenges, formulate research evaluation standards for the discipline, contribute to the establishment of music production and digital library management standards, engage a variety of stakeholders from different disciplines of academia and industry and deliver innovative platforms for co-creative workshops focusing on horizon-scanning and technology foresight. The roadmap will also include a framework for the establishment of a MIR excellence network, involving the field drivers and stakeholders (music researchers, industry representatives, strategists and policy makers).The MIReS action is therefore expected to impact on (i) policy making and research planning (alignment to other ongoing initiatives such as CHORUS+ or the Media Search Cluster); (ii) technological innovation addressing standards in the field, state-of-the-art description and future challenges definition; (iii) new social behaviours, creativity, economy and education; and (iv) long-term transfer of innovation to industry ensuring future academic excellence and EU competitiveness in the world music market.";"2017-04-20 02:14:28";"100794"

In the last years, she has become interested in two new applications of the Malliavin calculus, which are Statistical Inference for SDEs and applications to Mathematical Finance.The aim of this proposal is to consider two different types of SDES: (i) SDEs driven by the sum of a Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure; (ii) SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion. The coefficients of both SDEs are assumed to depend on some parameter  that needs to be estimated in the following cases: (a) when the trajectory of the SDE is observed continuously during a fixed time interval; (b) when the trajectory is observed discretely at n fixed times. Both cases will be studied, but the proposal concentrates in case (b), as is a more challenging and realistic problem.The proposal is divided into three research projects whose goals are: (1) Obtain upper and lower bounds for the density of the solution to the two types of SPDEs (i) and (ii), by means of the Malliavin Calculus; (2) Use these bounds in order to prove the local asymptotic normality (LAN) for the models (i) and (ii), and then apply Hajek-Lecam's theorem to obtain asymptotically efficient estimators for the parameter of the equations; (3) Study Monte Carlo methods and exact simulation of the SDE model with jumps (i), and apply these computational methods to the following financial problems: jump volatility models and numerical computations of greeks.In addition to the three research projects, the proposal aims to develop a research network on Stochastic Analysis and applications, by organizing weekly seminars and two international conferences at the University Pompeu Fabra, where the researcher has been offered a permanent associate professor position.";"2016-06-27 11:04:34";"108019"

In the present project, the candidate will have exclusive access to one of these datasets which consists of brain recordings in primates during a decision making task.  The candidate will employ his expertise in some areas of information theory and coding to formulate a novel hypothesis to be tested on these available data. This hypothesis states that causal interactions between neurons in a population encode information about decisions. This interdisciplinary line of investigation represents a changing point in the candidate’s career. On the one hand, the candidate will be trained in the neurophysiological aspects of the problem. On the other, he will develop emerging methods to capture causal interactions between neuronal responses and then represent the hypothesized “encoding patterns”. From a scientific point of view, this project will provide one of the key tools to understand information processing in a decision-making process and  study sources of brain disorder based on the dynamics of encoding patterns.

Arguably, employment risk is one of the biggest sources of uncertainty most individuals face in their life time. Likewise, exploiting the synergies and complementarities between differentially skilled workers is amongst the greatest challenges to firms' hiring decisions. The objective is to analyze the efficiency properties and as a consequence evaluate the role for policy. In order to establish the implications of the mechanisms that govern risk and diversity, I elaborate on concrete applications and discuss estimation in different labor market settings.In the presence of Labor Market Risk I address the question how asset holdings exacerbate wage inequality. Workers are exposed to the risk of unemployment, and workers with few assets will trade off the lower riskiness of a job against lower wages. Different asset holdings translate into different wages, thus amplifying inequality due to assets with wage inequality. The proposed analysis of unemployment risk can solve for an equilibrium model that incorporates the distribution of assets, while at the same time allowing for heterogeneity in skills. There is no doubt that fully understanding the asset-skill tradeoff is of primary importance for labor market policy. I then study a different angle of labor market risk, namely risk that is due to matching stochastic types, which introduces ex post mismatch. Ex ante, agents match based on the distribution of possible realizations of ex post types. This model is conducive to identification of complementarities between workers and the value of risk sharing.Skill Diversity, or the allocation of differentially skilled workers across firms of different productivity, is a central feature of the labor market. The aim of this research is to embed the optimal worker composition within firms into standard macro environments to study technological change, information aggregation and spatial diversity.";"2017-11-20 13:58:22";"188486"

The main aim of the project is to increase our understanding of legal and normative discourse in light of contemporary accounts of the semantics and pragmatics of deontic modals, and of collective intentionality. This is a highly interdisciplinary project, connecting various philosophical disciplines with jurisprudence. The project will apply state-of-the-art theories and arguments of contextualist semantics about deontic modals and value predicates to the case of statements of law (i.e. statements of what, according to law, one ought to do). This will be achieved by a systematic exploration of the relationship between four debates in four different areas: first, the problem of the semantics and pragmatics of ought and might claims in philosophy of language; second, the debate on the perspectival nature of legal statements in legal philosophy; third, the debate on dispositional accounts of normative facts and values in metaphysics; and fourth the debate on collective intentionality in the philosophy of mind and action. Marques believes that there is a common set of issues underlying these seldom-connected debates. Her guiding research idea is that contextualist semantics is adequate for all normative statements, and difficult cases can be explained with a combination of (i) pragmatic accounts of the metalinguistic selection of appropriate standards, and (ii) proper accounts of collective intentionality. The project will pursue three objectives in particular: (O1) To develop the case for contextualism about deontic modals in the domain of normative legal statements and judgments. (O2) To investigate the role of joint commitments and collective intentionality in normative disputes, and the constitution of normative facts. (O3) To assess the relevance of the results achieved under O1 and O2 for the ongoing debate about legal positivism and the nature of law.";"2017-02-21 09:06:42";"187671"

The aim is to determine the basic elements that make countries more prone to social conflicts and then identify a set of feasible policies to prevent future episodes of violence. The project considers the causes and the propagation mechanisms of social conflicts of different intensity. The main objective of the project is to the study the institutional designs that may prevent, or mitigate, such social conflicts. Therefore, the analysis of economic institutions (such as property rights, etc.), political institutions and structure (democracy, decentralization, political systems, etc.), and the type of political leaders, that can help to prevent, conflict in potentially conflictive societies. From a methodological perspective, the project proposes to overcome some statistical pitfalls present in most of the previous literature on the determinants of civil wars and conflicts. The use of simple linear regressions, or a probit/logit specification, imposes very strong identification conditions that are likely to be violated. The current consensus, which emerges from those analyses, is that poverty is the single, most important determinant of civil wars. This result could be an artifact of simultaneity problems: the incidence of civil wars and poverty may be driven by the same determinants, some of which are probably missing. We propose to check the robustness of this consensus idea, and the importance of the institutional design, using other econometric procedures (instrumental variables and matching methods) which are subject to weaker identification conditions than the traditional regressions. Finally, we plan to investigate methods to deal with the missing data problem that plague the study of the determinants of civil wars.";"2017-05-29 12:34:13";"87583"

The importance of this question is that concepts permit us to bring meaning to our experiences; they are core to language and nonverbal behavior and their impairment after brain damage generates significant disability. Previous studies have mostly focused on object concepts (e.g., animals, tools, etc.) rather than action concepts (i.e., to run, to think, etc.). In our view, exploring our conceptual representations of actions is fundamental for obtaining a more complete picture of how the brain mediates our knowledge of the world. In this project we use the functional magnetic resonance imaging technique (fMRI) with healthy individuals as a tool for addressing two controversial questions in the field. First, we will examine whether a differential representation of action and object concepts exists in a particular brain region (the posterior-lateral-temporal cortex- PLTC). In particular, we will try to demonstrate that the PLTC subserves the representation of actions relative to objects, and that this is due to a conceptual (action vs. object) rather than a grammatical (verb vs. noun) distinction (Experiment 1). Then, we will examine whether  the PLTC is specialized in representing action concepts to the extent that it differentially responds to homophone words marked as verbs (she drinks) relative those marked as nouns (these drinks; Experiment 2). Second, we will determine the nature of action concepts by examining whether they are represented in an abstract manner (Experiment 3). If so, we will investigate whether the amount of motion information carried by an action (e.g., run vs. think) influences how these abstract representations are organized in the brain (Experiment 4).";"2019-08-02 10:20:15";"99212"

My interest in EP was stimulated during my postdoctoral position at the University of California at Berkeley (2005-2009). There I had the opportunity to participate in the process in which Prof. Rubinsky brought the concept of using irreversible EP as an ablation technique from a mere idea into a clinical reality. In May 2009 I moved to Prof. Mir's lab at Villejuif (France) as a preliminary step in order to reintegrate myself into the EP European research arena. During the 90s, Prof. Mir pioneered the use of EP for enhancing the penetration of anti-tumor drugs. Control over the field magnitude that develops in tissues is crucial for EP therapies. During my postdoctoral position I introduced a set of techniques for such a purpose based on the concept of employing conductive gels. Feasibility of this method was demonstrated experimentally in superficial tumors and I anticipate that this methodology could be also useful for the treatment of different cancers, particularly those located in hollow organs such as esophagus, stomach and colon, which in some occasions are inoperable with current techniques.

Yet, our perceptual experience is not a sensory piecemeal, but a unitary phenomenon brought about by Multisensory Integration mechanisms. MSI is in charge of binding sensory input to create faithful and coherent representations of the environment, an ability that confers important advantages in terms of optimizing behavioural outcomes. For example, people often find it easier to speak with someone when they can see their partner’s face, as lip and facial movements compensate for acoustic noise. The novelty of the project is that it focuses on internal processes, and in particular attention, to be of utmost importance during MSI. Attention enables efficient allocation of limited cognitive and neural resources, and therefore it plays a paramount role in perception, cognition and action. The aim is to understand the interplay between attention and the mechanisms of multisensory integration. Unravelling this interplay presents important challenges but, in return, promises to provide very important insights into how perception is accomplished by the humanmind and brain. In particular, the driving hypothesis underlying the present proposal is that objects of perception are multi-sensory defined events, and that attention plays a key role in building up and maintaining these perceptual representations. The strategy is to address this dynamic interplay between MSI and Attention by addressing a set of key specific research questions by means of converging methodological approaches.

The Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC) project aims at resolving this paradox by using a multi-disciplinary approach to show the functional role of consciousness in adaptive behaviour, to identify its underlying neuronal principles and to construct a neuromorphic robot based real-time conscious architecture. CDAC proposes that the shift from surviving in a physical world to one that is dominated by intentional agents requires radically different control architectures combining parallel and distributed control loops to assure real-time operation together with a second level of control that assures coherence through sequential coherent representation of self and the task domain, i.e. consciousness.

Most IT research is being carried out with a western centred approach and as a result, our data models, cognition models, user models, interaction models, ontologies, … are all culturally biased. This fact is quite evident in music information research, since, despite the world's richness in musical cultures, most of the research is centred on CDs and metadata of our western commercial music. CompMusic wants to break this huge research bias. By approaching musical information modelling from a multicultural perspective it aims at advancing our state of the art while facilitating the discovery and reuse of the music produced outside the western commercial context. But the development of computational models to address the world’s music information richness cannot be done from the West looking out; we have to involve researchers and musical experts immersed in the different cultures. Their contribution is fundamental to develop the appropriate multicultural musicological and cognitive frameworks from which we should then carry our research on finding appropriate musical features, ontologies, data representations, user interfaces and user centred approaches.

Using these music cultures as case studies, cultures that are alive and have a strong influence in current society, we can develop rich information models that can take advantage of the existing information coming from musicological and cultural studies, from mature performance practice traditions and from active social contexts. With this approach we aim at challenging the current western centred information paradigms, advance our IT research, and contribute to our rich multicultural society.";"2019-08-02 10:07:24";"99349"

Neural models implementing Bayesian models have proved useful to uncover neural computations in a variety of paradigms. Still no existing neurocomputational model provides a general framework for understanding perception in naturalistic conditions. Indeed these models suffer from three shortcomings: i) they cannot perform accurate inference in naturalistic environments where numerous objects interact in complex fashion; ii) they cannot simultaneously represent likelihood estimates over the presence of several objects in the same graphical model; iii) they cannot deal with correlated sensory evidence, though such correlations are ubiquitous in sensory systems.We propose a new unifying model of perception called Constrained Entropy Maximization Network (CEMNet) that provides a theoretical framework for inference in complex naturalistic environments. CEMNet stores an internal model of the environment by representing regularities across stochastic variables as constraints; those constraints shape the response of the network. The aim of the project is to develop the computational model of CEMNet and test it empirically. We will first study how CEMNet can be implemented in a realistic neural network. Second, we will simulate the network and show that, unlike existing neural models, CEMNet can deal with the difficulties of inference in complex environments. Third, a behavioral experiment will monitor how human subjects integrate correlated sensory evidence. Last, we will probe the ability of human subjects to simultaneously maintain likelihood estimates over multiple interacting variables in an audiovisual motion integration paradigm. We will record neural signals in MagnetoEncephaloGraphy while subjects perform the task and look for a specific neural signature of CEMNet signals.";"2016-06-20 10:55:47";"188178"

If meters are read incorrectly or not read at all, it will cause a chain reaction of added events that add unnecessary expense and create customer dissatisfaction. Additionally, it has been well established that one of the main reasons for the EU negative balance in the supply and consumption of gas are faults in measurements. Consortium SMEs have identified a clear need to develop a metropolitan gas/water metering system based on wire-less technology to send gas and water supplies readings to their control centre. The system will require no maintenance (battery powered sensors with life-time about 10-15 years) and will provide authenticable and secure data transmission. Timely and accurate recording of the consumption of gas, water and electricity is important as it will also help in identifying any leakages through the analysis of the actual quantity supplied and recorded by the meters. The commercial objective is to develop an ultra low power-consumption, battery-powered, wireless, cost effective and self organizing sensor network for maintenance-free automatic home meter reading applications. This network will be form by smart sensors which will include gas or water counter, logging consumption, outage detection, real-time clock and 2-way communications for remote control (i.e. switch on/switch off) and will support a huge number of sensors (+100).";"2019-07-16 22:16:59";"92925"

The protease cleaves viral polyprotein chains resulting in virion maturation and infectivity. The first stage of this process is the association of such chains containing embedded pseudo-folded protease monomers, followed by the intramolecular autocatalytic cleavage of the protease out of the polyprotein chains. Whilst, the structure, dynamics and function of mature/free HIV-1 protease have been extensively studied at the atomistic level, the molecular structure and binding mechanism of the embedded autocatalytic protease are unknown. Using large scale fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on the microsecond timescale, afforded by the computational infrastructure of GPUGrid, the transient structure, dynamics and auto-binding mechanism of embedded HIV-1 protease will be investigated. The aim of these investigations is to distinguish at a molecular level (a) the gating mechanism of mature HIV-1 protease in response to ligands (b) the gating mechanism of intramolecular N-terminal association of the embedded HIV-1 protease and (c) the feasibility of intramolecular C-terminal cleavage by the protease. The release of mature HIV-1 protease is a critical rate-limiting step in the maturation of the virus. Successful inhibition of this stage of the viral life-cycle may lead to a potent increase in the efficacy of AIDS therapy. Unfortunately, structure-based inhibitors designed for the mature/free protease are ineffective against the embedded-protease. A final aim of this investigation will thus be to identify an ensemble of macromolecular structures that could be used as pharmacophores in the development of inhibitors that target the embedded protease.";"2017-05-29 20:05:47";"94746"

More generally, primate genomes have been found enriched for this complex patterns of interspersed segmental duplications.This 5% of euchromatin differs in structure and content between closely related primates and is not easily resolved by whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly methods.This proposal focuses on this 5% of the genome that historically has been the most difficult for sequence and assembly.The aim of this research is to reconstruct the evolutionary history of all primate segmental duplications in 6 species of primates (Human, Chimpanzee, Orangutan, Gibbon and Macaque and Marmoset) and to understand gene innovations that have emerged within these dynamic genomic regions.   The Main goals of the proposal are: 1.SDs detection and analysis of non-human primate genomes.  2.SDs validation (by means of FISH and CGH arrays hybridizations) 3.Analyze species-specific functional elements and their polymorphism and divergence patterns  The proposed work not only can assist/direct efforts in these regions but serve as a benchmark of the quality of the final sequenced genomes, and, as such, benefit the genomics/evolutionary/genetics community as a whole. The long-term goal is to create an integrated view of the evolution of primate segmental duplications by studying changes in the composition, frequency, size and location at the major branchpoints in the primate phylogeny.  This work has the ancillary benefit that it will provide inssight the origin of SD structure associated with genomic disease and characterize lineage-specific genes relevant to realization of these primates as models of human disease and to the adaptation of these species.";"2019-07-16 10:10:14";"88010"

Computer scientists have also become involved, trying to program artificial agents in such a way that they are able to self-organize a language-like system from scratch. There are already some successful simulations. They endow agents with language strategies in the form of networks of embodied cognitive functions for producing, comprehending, learning and aligning some aspect of language, for example to express participant roles in events using a case grammar. The present project goes one step further and inquires about the origins of these language strategies and how they can become shared in a population, based on the hypothesis that language strategies form in each individual by the epigenetic recruitment and exaptation of distributed networks, which support the strategies culturally emerging in a population.The project will develop the computational foundations for this ‘recruitment theory of language origins’, engage in simulations and robotic experiments, and validate them from a linguistic and biological point of view. It will look at the genetic bases of language by conducting Genome-wide Association Studies correlating phenotypic variation in linguistic aptitude, particularly for language learning, with genetic markers. At the end of this interdisciplinary project a more encompassing picture of language evolution should begin to emerge, illuminating the cultural, cognitive and genetic factors that have played a role in the origins and evolution of language.";"2016-06-27 10:40:34";"100144"

One of the greatest difficulties for the learners of second languages (L2) is to accurately produce and perceive the speech sounds (phonemes) of the new language and, despite educational efforts of foreign language programs, few individuals manage to achieve high proficiency levels in these skills. The present study aims to investigate the functional and anatomical brain correlates of variability in the degree of success in the learning of the L2 phonemes.Our research question will be addressed by investigating (i) functional, (ii) morphological, and (iii) functional connectivity differences between good and poor perceivers of the L2 by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Individual differences in the learning of the L2 sounds will investigate all the levels of the phonological processing hierarchy (i.e., processes that cover auditory-sensory analysis, speech analysis, and attention) involved in producing and perceiving native phonemes.The results of this research are not only relevant because they will enhance our knowledge about how the brain processes and learns languages but also because they have the potential to help in the development of efficient language teaching programs.""";"2015-03-11 14:05:09";"106991"

At this juncture, cellular systems have become limited, first and foremost, by their own interference. It is becoming increasingly clear that major new improvements in spectral efficiency will have to entail addressing such intercell interference. Traditionally, a user is assigned to a cell and it then communicates with that cell site while causing interference to all other sites in the system. The premise of NetMIMO is that, in the uplink specifically, intercell interference is merely a superposition of signals that were intended for other cell sites, i.e., signals that happen to have been collected at the wrong place. If these signals could be properly classified and routed, they would in fact cease to be interference and become useful in the detection of the information they bear. (A dual observation can be made about the downlink.) This insight naturally leads to the conclusion that, ultimately, the goal should be to serve all users through all the sites within their range of influence. While challenging, this is theoretically possible by virtue of the fact that the cell sites are connected by a powerful backbone network. This ambitious idea leverages the almost unlimited bandwidth available in optical wireline networks to transcend the burden of wireless intercell interference. In the NetMIMO framework then, the notion of a cell gets blurred once users are no longer assigned to specific sites. Ultimately, there is a network of sites serving a pool of users. While this is a conceptually simple proposition, it poses numerous hurdles and challenges that this project aims to resolve.";"2019-07-16 21:09:25";"88744"

Current desert dwellers are, in fact, living archives of successful adaptation to arid lands, expressed in a set of tangible and intangible values, which are yet to be fully understood. Nowadays, global warming and dry lands expansion require fresh tools to study pastoralists adaptation in the old world deserts, via innovative and multidisciplinary approaches.
